        "text": "⚙️ Installation Guide Follow these simple steps to get  ShadowGuard  up and running on your server. 🚀 📦 1. Download & Unpack After completing your payment 💳, you will receive the  ShadowGuard  folder. Unzip the file if necessary, and make sure you have the full folder ready. 📂 2. Move to Server Place the  ShadowGuard  folder into your server’s  resources  directory. Example path: /resources/[your_folder]/ShadowGuardAC Or /resources/ShadowGuardAC 📝 3. Add to Server CFG Open your server configuration file  server.cfg  and add the following line: Shell ensure  ShadowGuardAC This will make sure the script loads every time your server starts. ✅ 4. Restart Your Server Once everything is in place: Save the  server.cfg  file. Restart your server. Verify in the server console that  ShadowGuard  has started successfully. 💡  Tips: Keep your folder name exactly as  ShadowGuard  (case-sensitive). If you use categories for resources, place it inside the correct folder (e.g.,  [anticheat] ). Always back up your server before adding new scripts. 🎯 You’re all set — enjoy your secure and stable server!"

        "text": "📋 Requirements Guide Before installing and running  ShadowGuard , please make sure your server meets the following requirements. This will help avoid errors and ensure the anti-cheat runs smoothly. ⚡ 🖥 1. Screen Capture Dependency ShadowGuard  requires the  Screen Capture  library to function correctly. 📥  Download & Install: Go to  https://github.com/itschip/screencapture . Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository. Ensure the resource is started  before   ShadowGuardAC  in your  server.cfg . Example: Shell ensure  screencapture \n ensure  ShadowGuardAC 🛠️ 2. FiveM Artifact Build Compatibility Depending on your  server artifact version , you may need to manually adjust your scripts due to FiveM sandbox restrictions. If your artifact build ≤ 10188 You don't need to do anything, ShadowGuard will automatically edit and add processing functions. If your artifact build > 10188 (or latest builds) You will need to manually add the Module to the scripts used in the server. fxmanifest.lua  or  _resource.lua Lua client_script  '@ShadowGuardAC/module.lua' 💡  Why is this needed? ⛔ In newer builds, FiveM limits automatic script injection between resources. Adding this line ensures  ShadowGuard  can communicate properly with your client scripts. 🔄  Future Plans:  We are actively working to improve automation for new artifact builds so that this step can be handled automatically in future updates. ❗ Important warning, please check very carefully what scripts are running in the server, if you do not do the full  Module  addition it will cause many problems and the system will not be able to work properly. Please follow what to do in the server control panel, we integrate warnings if you have not done it 🔍 3. General Recommendations ✅ Use the  latest stable build  of FiveM unless you have a reason to stay on an older version. 📂 Keep  ShadowGuardAC  and related dependencies in the same  resources  folder group for better organization (e.g.,  [anticheat] ). 🔄 Restart your server after adding new dependencies to make sure changes are applied. 🛡️ Always keep a  backup  of your server before making changes. ⚠   Important: Correctly installing all requirements is  mandatory . If these requirements are not met,  ShadowGuard  may fail to start, or errors will occur during use."

    "/introduction/shadowguard-anticheat/config/": {
        "title": "Config",
        "text": "⚙️ Configuration Guide This page will guide you through configuring  ShadowGuard   to work with your server’s framework and security requirements. 🛡️ 👤 1. Functional requirements for players This setting determines  when  ShadowGuard   starts operating for a player . You need to trigger it  when the player has fully joined the server  (e.g., after character selection). Example: Lua Config. PlayerLoaded  =  \"esx:playerLoaded\"  \n -- For ESX Framework \n \n -- OR \n Config. PlayerLoaded  =  \"qb-core:client:OnPlayerLoaded\"  \n -- For QBCore Framework \n \n -- OR \n Config. PlayerLoaded  =  \"YOUR_FRAMEWORK_OR_SELECT_CHARACTER_EVENT\"  💡  Tip: If you use a  custom character selection script , trigger the  Config.PlayerLoaded  event right after your player spawns in the game world. 🔑 2. Request with Image Token This is required for  image storage and processing  during  ShadowGuard   operations. The token is provided by  FiveManage . 📥  Get your token here:   https://fivemanage.com/ Example: Lua Config.Token  =  \"your_fivemanage_token_here\" ⚠    Important: Keep this token  private  — never share it publicly. If your token is invalid or missing,  image-based protections will not work . 🛡️ 3. Other Protection Settings All additional protection features can be configured inside:  config.lua Here you can enable/disable specific anti-cheat modules such as: 🚫  Anti-Godmode 👀  Anti-Freecam 🏃  Anti-Speed Hack 🔫  Weapon Restrictions 🎯  Aimbot Detection ... 💡  Recommendation: Always review and adjust these settings according to your server’s needs. Disabling key protections may reduce security. 📌 Final Notes Ensure  Config.PlayerLoaded  is  correctly set  to your framework’s event, otherwise ShadowGuardAC will not activate for players. Config.Token  from  FiveManage  is  mandatory  for full functionality. Review  config.lua  regularly after updates to take advantage of new protections. 🎯 With these configurations set, your server will be ready to run  ShadowGuard   at its best performance."
